            <h1>Tuna Noodle Casserole, Sipiora Style</h1>

            <p>
                When I was young, one of the first things I ever learned to make on the stove
                was Tuna Noodle Casserole, or as I called it back then, Tuna Casserole. Our
                Sipiora version is very different from most other <em>true</em> casseroles 
                out there, as it doesn't involve baking at all.
            
                <blockquote><strong>But that's not a casserole at all, you cry.</strong></blockquote> 
                You're right. It's not. It's still my favorite food in the world, the food I reach for 
                every time I'm sick, want comfort food, or just feel like eating a huge bowl of warm
                noodles covered in non-tomato sauce. This is that recipe.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 10oz can, Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup</li>
                <P>
                <li>1 can albacore tuna in water, any size</li>
            </P>
            <p>
                <li>1/3c milk (or water if you're pressed)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>4 oz wide or extra wide egg noodles</li>
                </p>
                <p><em>Who am I kidding? Pick your favorite pasta, and use it! It'll soak up all the 
                    delicious sauce no matter what.
                </em></p>
                <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set a quart of water to boil on the stove.</li>
                <li>Add noodles and cook according to directions.</li>
                <li>Open the cream of mushroom soup. Open and drain the albacore tuna.</li>
                <li>Mix the two in a medium bowl, breaking up larger chunks of tuna.</li>
                <li>Add milk and stir until combined. </li>
                <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <p><blockquote><em>I normally add only pepper, as the cream of mushroom
                    soup is salty enough on its own.</em></blockquote></p>
                <li>Drain noodles and add to mixture. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Enjoy with your favorite veggie.</li>
                <p><blockquote><em>Pro Tip: add the veggies directly to the mixture.
                     Thank me later!</em></blockquote></p>

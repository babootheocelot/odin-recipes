           <h2>Eggs, glorious eggs. </h2>
       </p>
       <p>
           My absolute favorite morning meal go-to. They always taste good, I can 
           customize them a million different ways, and I can have my stomach full
           in about 15 minutes' time.

           Now, these are not your mama's scrambled eggs. Hell, they're definitely not <em>my</em> mama's
           scrambled eggs. I love my mom-- she's great at so, so many things. However, one of those things
           is not making scrambled eggs. She tries to cook them in about a minute on the highest heat.
           <blockquote><strong>Not. Good.</strong></blockquote>
           I have since learned better. Here is my recipe for no-fail, delicious scrambled eggs in folded sheet form,
           perfect for topping toast, or a tortilla!
       </p>
       <p> 
           <h1>Ingredients</h1> </p>
           <ul>
              <li>Eggs, or egg whites. (<em>DUH.</em>)</li> 
            <p>I usually use two whole eggs plus a quarter cup of egg whites
                 in the morning, but you can use as many as you want,
                no judgement here! Get those gains, eat <strong>ALL the food</strong>. </p>
                <li>Butter, enough to coat the bottom and lower 1/2 inch of your pan.</li>
                <p><em>Sure</em>, it's not the healthiest, but it tastes delicious,
                and if the French say it makes the best eggs, I will not argue.
            They <em>know their eggs</em>.</p>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Add ins: Chopped bacon or sausage, mushrooms, onions, shredded cheese, or whatever your heart desires!
                <p><blockquote>Note: adding high-water content foods like veggies will water down
                    your resulting eggs. I saute veggies separately and add them after.
                </blockquote></p></li>
           </ul>
            <p>
            <h1>Recipe</h1></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a 10 inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
                    <li>Let it warm for about 5 minutes. <strong>Do not rush this!</strong></li>
                    <li>While the pan is warming, crack your eggs or pour your egg whites into a small bowl. Salt and pepper
                        to taste. Whisk vigourously with a fork until color is uniform.</li>
                    <li>Coat pan with butter liberally. If butter immediately browns, turn heat down and remove pan from stove.
                        (It's too hot and will burn your eggs.) Start over. You'll thank me later.
                    If butter forms small bubbles, gently pour in your egg mixture.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 2 minutes, then sprinkle in your mix-ins.</li>
                    <li>Use a silicone spatula to gently push one side of the eggs towards the opposite side, then slide
                        accordion-folded eggs back to the center of the skillet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Continue to fold eggs until desired level of doneness. I like mine on the edge of shiny. </li>
                   
                    <li>Remove from heat, transfer to plate (or toast, or tortilla!). Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper to finish</li>

                </ol>
            </ul>
